;;; run-tests.el --- Batch ERT runner with a test-count floor  -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;;; Commentary:

;; `ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit' exits 0 when it runs *no* tests, so a suite
;; that silently stops being discovered - a rename, a load failure swallowed
;; somewhere, a selector that matches nothing - reports a green build having
;; verified nothing at all.  This runner additionally fails when fewer than
;; `run-tests-minimum' tests ran.
;;
;; The floor is a floor, not an exact count: adding tests never breaks it,
;; but losing a chunk of the suite does.
;;
;; Usage: emacs -Q --batch -L . -L test -l test/run-tests.el

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)

;; `load' prefers time-uuid-mode.elc over a newer .el, so a bare `make test'
;; after an edit silently exercises the last compile - another green run that
;; verified nothing, which is the whole point of this file.
